This is a project where I will create a tool that will analyse NFL data to identify players that, within a given league, are worth picking up in NFL fantasy given the rules and teams. It will also possibly suggest trades of mutual upside, therefore trades that are likely to be accepted. 

The key structure will be:
1. Start with input data from the NFL for performance over the season and pre-season predictions of expected points in fantasy
2. Take the input data from the particular fantasy league.
3. Identify players that are over/under performing with expectations based on strength of schedule
4. Identify mutually beneficial trades that can be leveraged
5. Make recommendations of free agents that could be picked up and who they should be in place of
