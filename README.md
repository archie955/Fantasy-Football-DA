This is a project where I will create a tool that will analyse NFL data to identify players that, within a given league, are worth picking up in NFL fantasy given the rules and teams. It will also possibly suggest trades of mutual upside, therefore trades that are likely to be accepted. 

The key structure will be:
1. Start with input data from the NFL for performance over the season and pre-season predictions of expected points in fantasy
2. Take the input data from the particular fantasy league.
3. Identify players that are over/under performing with expectations based on strength of schedule
4. Identify mutually beneficial trades that can be leveraged
5. Make recommendations of free agents that could be picked up and who they should be in place of

TO DO LIST:
- Add function to mock trade with either 1 for 1 or 2 for 2 trades
- Add function that ties this all together, appending to a list all of the possible trades and how much of an improvement they are for both teams and the teams involved, most likely through a dictionary (list of dicts)
- Finally add the endpoint for this and allow it to simulate trades and find the optimal
- Then perhaps add visualisations of all the possible trades, this can be left though as visualisations are not that natural of an extension for a project like this.

In this project I consider a valid trade one which is statistically grounded for both individuals. If a trade is to the negative of one I deem it not statistically grounded. This is not to say it cannot happen, but is to say it is based on some meta-reasoning rather than the standard projection. The way a trade can be mutually beneficial is if someone can replace a starter with their bench player for a small loss in points, that is more than made up for by getting a big improvement elsewhere in the team in the trade in which they lose their starter. Trades where you directly trade a bench player for someone that would be a starter for you are obvious and do not require analysis to identify, as there is clear benefit for you. This obviously means this will not identify every possible trade, as this could be anything and requires far more context than can be programmed, but this will heuristically identify some trades that fit in the following criteria:

Suppose team A has 2 QB and 2 TE, as does team B. The league rules are set up such that teams have 1 starting QB and 1 starting TE. Suppose team A's players are projected (on a per week basis) the following: QB1-22 pts, QB2-19 pts, TE1-8 pts, TE2-6 pts for a projected starting total of 30 pts. Meanwhile, team B's players are projected: QB1-20 pts, QB2-16 pts, TE1-12 pts, TE2-11 pts for a projected starting total of 32 pts.
If then the teams do the following trade: A gives B QB1 and TE1, B gives A QB1 and TE1 then the teams projected starting goes to A = 32 pts and B = 33 pts. Both teams have profited from this, but it isn't a trade you'd initially consider as it involves trading starters and the raw total points makes you on face value reconsider (as QB are worth more than TE, a trade where you downgrade QB to upgrade TE may seem bad, but in actuality all that matters is points-over-replacement). This is what I mean by a statistically well-founded trade, and is what I hope to identify in this scenario.

Some of the limitations I place are that trades are either 1 for 1 or 2 for 2. The reason I do this is trades involving 3 players from one team are rare and it is almost a guarantee that one of the players being traded is a bench player on both teams, in which case they are somewhat redundant and the reasoning is either to add depth to a position or for some contextual reason. The player can freely alter these trades as they please and add 3rds if they so please/are required to to get the trade accepted, this is an area the player does not need any help. Likewise some trades may be 2 for 1, but the 2 for 2 should completely contain this by simply doing the 2 for 1 trade with a random bench player that once again can be freely removed by the player, no support needed. This is not a be-all and end-all, but rather a tool to save some time and identify possible trading avenues you may miss. Without the context of the people trading it is not possible to completely determine viable trades, just demonstrate that a trade involving your star player might actually be worth it, you can then work out the fine details.
